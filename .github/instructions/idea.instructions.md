we have a research project titled "Noise Management in Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using NTRU-RLWE".

"This new hybrid scheme:

1. Encrypts and decrypts data faster
2. Manages noise and bootstrapping more efficiently
3. Enables multiparty encryption
4. Supports extensive computation on encrypted data

With new research in homomorphic encryption, the NTRU-RLWE hybrid scheme stands out primarily due to it merging the computational efficiency of NTRU, alongside the robust security assurances of RLWE based constructions. This combination achieves efficient encryption, decryption, and especially bootstrapping operations, while supporting secure multiparty computations and still maintaining resistance to known attacks. With multi-key homomorphic decryption using NTRU and RLWEâ€™s strong theoretical foundations, this hybrid approach resolves early hiccups in noise management and scaling. Still, the NTRU-RLWE scheme emerges as effective and secure for computations when privacy and data encryption is required."

please build a proof of concept in python code and prove its novelty.
implement bootstrapping for the algorithm to compare as well.
use complete code and use existing libraries that support lattice operations.
implement all the code fully and not simulate them.
try and make this project modular.
try to compare this new approach against exisiting schemes like ckks, and bvk schemes using the tenseal library.
generate charts and graphs and save the values of the evaluations.
